# Vendor Performance Analysis

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry.

## Overview

This project focuses on identifying underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.  

Since the data required for analysis is distributed across multiple tables, a **summary table** needs to be created that consolidates key information, including:

- **Purchase transactions** made by vendors  
- **Sales transaction data**  
- **Freight costs** for each vendor (representing delivery costs)  
- **Actual product prices** from vendors  

This consolidated dataset enables a comprehensive vendor performance analysis, helping improve decision-making for promotions, pricing, and inventory management.
